# ECG-Signal-Prediction-and-Anamoly-Detection

This project investigates the application of deep learning models for predicting the next
heartbeat in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We explore the effectiveness of two prominent
architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) + Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
and convlstm. We examine a combined ConvLSTM model that leverages the strengths of both CNNs
and LSTMs. The models are trained and evaluated using data from the publicly available ECG5000
dataset. By comparing the performance of these models, we aim to identify the most effective approach
for predicting the next heartbeat in ECG data. This project has the potential to contribute to
advancements in real-time cardiac health monitoring and arrhythmia detection.
